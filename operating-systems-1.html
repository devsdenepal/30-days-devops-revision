<p>To remember: <code>Dev's laptop speed was too slow so, he opened Task scheduler to see processes, then checked which service* is taking the memory and terminated a process from there. He was yet not satisfied so, he opened explorer to see files in `downloads` folder. Then he attached his mouse with the laptop. The laptop recognixed the device . Then he saw a previous alert saying "a malicious file detected by Windows AV. After fixing that he goes to listen music but a mediaplayer was having problem with startup, so OS throuws him an error prompt.</code></p>
